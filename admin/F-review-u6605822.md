Review Comments:

1. He separated this task into three parts: get the score for exits, get the score for central tiles and get the score for dead ends. So he created three relevant methods. I think it is well-documented.

2. The best feature of these codes is that he pulled some useful codes out to create different methods. For example, method line, it can be used for task 12 as well.

3. He used proper capitalization both for methods and variables. But I the “getBasicScore” is an appropriate name for a class. I suggest that he can change it to “BasicScore”. 

4. For most of the variables and methods, he gave an appropriate name. But I think when name an ArrayList “xxxList” is a better style. Similarly, when name a map, “xxxMap” would be easier  for a reader to understand.

5. I have not found any potential errors the program will not function correctly.
