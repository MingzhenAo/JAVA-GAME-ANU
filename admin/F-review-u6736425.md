I am going to review the Class "Board".
1. Overview:
This class provides a method representing the Game Board with LinkedHashMap and some other method to support it.
 
2. These codes are well-documented and the program decomposition is appropriate, different methods are wrote for
 different aims, which are nicely separated and combined when needed. He wrote 7 methods in total,
 as method getBoard() is used to give a common frame for the others, so there are six methods implementing different aims.
 
3. I think the best feature of his code is its capability for reusing, those methods can be highly useful in other situations,
 which will be able to save other people's time when they try to work on something similar.
  He pulled out those public parts properly, making these methods clearer.
 
4. He used proper capitalization for both methods and parameters, which is good cause such detail work is usually ignored
 by most people
 
5. He properly named his parameters and methods, which helps a lot especially when other people are trying to read
 and understand his work.
